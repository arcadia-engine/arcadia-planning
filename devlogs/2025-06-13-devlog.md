# 🧪 Devlog: 2025-06-13 — ArcadiaApp Runtime Integration

Today marks a major architectural milestone: the decoupling of `GameLoop` logic and the introduction of a developer-facing runtime wrapper: `ArcadiaApp`.

---

## ✅ Completed

### 🔁 ArcadiaApp
- Added fluent builder interface (`.setRenderer()`, `.registerSystem()`, etc.)
- Orchestrates runtime flow without exposing internal engine setup
- Supports injection of renderer, input provider, systems, and scene

### 🧩 Scene Interface
- Defined `Scene` with `load(EntityManager)`
- Created `DemoScene` to contain demo map and entity loading logic
- Scene now owns its own `MapManager` and exposes it via `getMapManager()`

### 🔃 GameLoop Refactor
- Removed internal `setup()` method
- Now receives `EntityManager`, system list, and IO via constructor
- Runs cleanly at fixed 2 FPS for testing purposes

### 🧱 DemoMain
- Fully migrated to use `ArcadiaApp` and `DemoScene`
- LanternaRenderer + LanternaInputProvider handled externally
- Terminal startup, rendering, and input integration confirmed functional

---

## 🔍 Observations

- Code readability and flexibility have drastically improved
- Component-level injection is now clean and unopinionated
- Systems execute in declarative order based on `ArcadiaApp.registerSystem(...)`

---

## 🔜 Next Up

- Move `MapManager`, `Tile`, and `TileType` into `arcadia-core` permanently
- Begin file-based map loading (`TileMapLoader`)
- Write `SystemManager` for internal system registration and ordering
- Design `ArcadiaConnection` base class for client/server support
- Begin planning 2D animation components
