## 📅 Devlog Entry 001 – **Arcadia Begins**
🗓️ **Date**: June 12, 2025  
👤 **Author**: @Hemerley  

### Summary
Today marks the formal creation of the Arcadia Engine GitHub organization and project structure. After years of concept drafts and learning, the foundation for a long-term, modular 2D engine is now real.

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ Created `arcadia-engine` GitHub organization
- ✅ Set up 6 modular repositories:
  - `core`, `client`, `server`, `tools`, `demo`, `docs`
- ✅ Added LICENSE, README.md, and structure for each
- ✅ Established planning repo: `arcadia-planning`
- ✅ Published `ROADMAP.md` and `project-board.md`
- ✅ First visual branding complete (logo + identity)

### Reflection
This is more than just a project—Arcadia represents the shift from dreaming to *building*. Instead of imitating other engines or games, this is about crafting something modular, meaningful, and unique.

Even if it ships with a single zone or single quest, it will be mine. And finished.
