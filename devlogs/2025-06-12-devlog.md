🗓️ Devlog Entry – 2025-06-12 22:47

🎮 Module: arcadia-core

✅ Features Added:
- Introduced `VelocityComponent` and tile-based movement.
- Added `InputIntentComponent` and `PlayerControlledComponent` for ECS-based input mapping.
- Built `EntityFactory` to instantiate `player`, `wanderer`, and `static` objects.
- Implemented `RenderSystem` for ASCII tile grid using Lanterna.
- Verified `LanternaRenderer` handles screen clear and refresh correctly.
- Built `PhysicsSystem` to apply velocity and prevent movement into walls.
- `InputSystem` now supports blocking input via `LanternaInputProvider`.
- Engine logs now include ANSI color and timestamp support.
- `GameLoop` uses fixed-timestep logic (2 FPS for now).

🐛 Debugging Support:
- Resolved movement issue: input was functional, but user tested with arrow keys instead of `WASD`.
- Verified that velocity and position were updating properly in logs.
- Ensured entities render on the correct layer and obey collision.
- Added defensive null checks in input/physics/render systems.
- Improved `toString()` output for key components.

🔧 Project Cleanup:
- Moved `.git` to root (`arcadia-engine/`) to support unified repo.
- Added `.gitignore` for Java, IDE, and OS-specific clutter.
- Committed and pushed `arcadia-core` to main with updated structure.

🧠 Next Steps:
- Allow arrow key input alongside WASD.
- Begin `arcadia-client` module to test rendering/input without terminal dependency.
- Add `HealthComponent`, inventory UI, and static HUD renderer.
- Begin work on multiplayer prototype (`arcadia-net` module).
- Enhance devlog pipeline (e.g., auto-log commits or changelogs per push).
